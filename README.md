# Waste-Classification-using-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
A deep learning-based waste classification system that classifies waste into organic and inorganic categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training, with real-time image prediction capabilities for waste management applications.
